Due to the sensitive nature of the data we will not upload the original data for Milestone 1. 
We have uploaded a simulated database. 
We generated a new random data based on the frequencies of the original features.
This way we get a new random data with the same features. 
The marginal distribution of a selected feature will be the same as in the original data, but the features in the simulated data will be independent from each other. 
Locally we will work on our original data.
Later we will generate (e.g. by GAN) a new simulated dataset which will be better suited to test the neuralnetwork framework.

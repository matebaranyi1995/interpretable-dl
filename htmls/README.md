We have exported the jupyter notbooks as HTML files and also uploaded a report of the simulated data, which was created using ```pandas-profiler``` python module.
We did not upload the original notebooks, since those work only in the posession of the data.
Later we will include notebooks which will work on the provided simulated data.
